"If you are going to Sigiriya, you should definitely go to Pidurangala. It is not difficult to climb. But the journey through the trees and rocks is beautiful.",5
Best view. Fantastic place to visit. Sigiri view is amazing. Pidurangala is awesome. Best time is place climb the top before sunrise. Then you can enjoy the real beauty.,5
It was a ancient temple where most sacred buddhist monks were stayed. Few pilgrimages are still there and those were built couple of centuries ago. It is a small hike and it has stunning view in the highest point of the rock. Very beautiful ‚Ä¶,5

Such a beautiful place. Calm environment . You have to go through a buddhist temple to climb the rock. Lovely environment,5
How to reach: Colombo > Dambulla > pidurangala  Mode of transport : private vehicle and public transport also available  All ages can climb but who has knee problems it will be difficult to climb steps. But all in all nearly  40 mins hike ‚Ä¶,5
"The view from the top was breathtaking. You will have to pass through pidurangala rock cave temple. You wont find stairs after a certain distance.

Most senoric place with 360 panoramic view,5
"It is worth to climb upto the point where the Buddha Statute is found in the caves. Beyond this point, there is no historical value to be found. Last steps are a nightmare to climb. once you reach the top of the rock, of course you can take many beautiful pictures with the Sigiriya on the side.",3
